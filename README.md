# Surfs Up

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy more information about temperature trends in the area, before they decide to open a surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: 
- The mean temperature for both the months of June and December is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a desirable temperature of surfing and ice cream. 
- The minimum temperatures experienced in the months of June and December are 64 and 56 respectively. Even on the coldest days of these months, you can go into the ocean with a wetsuit. 
- The maximum temperatures experienced in the months of June and December are 85 and 83 respectively. The perfect temperature for some ice cream and a dip in the ocean. 

For more details on the statistics of each month, see below:

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
As shown in the results section, the statistics for the temperatures of June and December are favorable. W. Avy should feel comfortable opening the business year round, as the temperatures are not going to scare away the locals and tourists. Even on the coldest days, there should be enough business to turn a profit. I would like to run two additional queries to solidify the findings: 
- Precipitaion data: Even if the temperatures are warm enough for surfing and buying ice cream, i would like to create a summary identical to the one above on precipitation data. I believe precipitation could have more of a negative impact on the number of customers at W. Avys shop than temperatures. If there is lightning it s not suggested to enter the water and it will make it less likely for customers to be walking around town. 
- Year over Year data: It is common knowledge that climate change has been significantly affecting weather patterns around the world. I would like to conduct a similar statistical analysis on weather data over the last 5 years and compare it to the overall findings. This may point to weather patterns slightly changing in the most recent years and inform what we may see in the up coming years.
